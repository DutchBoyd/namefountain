# Namefountain.com Rails App

This app is under construction.  The intended functionality is to 
allow registered users to perform a whois lookup on a domain name,
and then mark that domain name with an alert.

A cron job will execute regular whois lookups on all of the domains
in the alert database and will notify users via email or SMS that
a domain they have an alert on it close to expiring, allowing them
to contact the domain holder before the domain drops and is released
to the competitive aftermarket auctionhouses.

The final project will be deployed under my doman [*NameFountain.com*](http://www.namefountain.com/).

I am fairly new to Rails development and am using the conventions set
forth in Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial book.  If you have any questions
or suggestions, please feel free to contact me at dutch@dutchboyd.com.
